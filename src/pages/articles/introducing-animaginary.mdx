Thinking like a rocket scientist is a way of thinking that is errs on the side of doubt, is ego-less, is open, is ambitious, and seeks the truth.  Here is how to do it (based on the book).

1. **Be willing to say, "I don't know."** Varol suggests readers lean towards trying to understand the world rather than trying to control it and the first step in that process is often admitting ignorance.   

2. **Embrace uncertainty.** Varol argues that our need for certainty often blinds us from the truth. Ego and hubris are contributing factors in this need to be certain, to be "right." That said, if we embrace uncertainty we increase the odds of having what might be considered a breakthrough for whatever we are trying to accomplish.

3. **Reason from "First Principles."** First principles are assertions that stand alone and can not be deduced from other assertions. They are truths that lay at the foundation of our thinking / arguments. To identify first principles, always start with what is true and try your best to question assumptions. An exercise Varol suggests that helps is one where you assume the role of the antagonist for your idea.

Subtract. Cut the junk. Reduce a system to its primary components -- it increased creativity, according to Varol. 

4. **Practice "Moonshot thinking."** Shoot for the stars, so to speak. Varol says that our expectations become self-fulling prophecies. Aiming for mediocrity will result in just that. 

5. **Be open to ideas.** Make sure you don't judge ideas before you spend some time with them. Divergent thinking is for drafting ideas. Convergent thinking is for evaluation ideas. The two ways of thinking are different and should be separate.

6. **Think in coulds instead of shoulds.** Ask yourself, "what could I do?" instead of "what should I do?" when solving a problem or thinking about the future.

7. **Ponder about "Science-fiction solutions."** Ask yourself when trying to solve a problem, "how might this work/ be solved in a fictitious future?"

8. **Focus on strategy, not tactics.** Strategies are plans for achieving an objective. Tactics are the actions you take to implement a strategy. If you focus on strategy (keeping the objective in mind), you can always change the tactics...something that might be beneficial in pursuit of a solution. 

9. **Watch out for confirmation bias.** Try not to overly weigh evidence that supports your preexisting beliefs / under-weigh evidence that contradicts them. Doing this will lead you away from what is true, according to Varol. 

11. **Hold opinions in your head as "working hypothesis."**

12. **Test your ideas as you go (don't wait to implement).**

13. **Learn from failures.**
