1. **Be grateful** - write down three things you are grateful for at the end of the each day. 

2. **Savor** - focus on an experience that brings you joy. Bring to life the psychical, sensory, emotional, and/or social aspects of the experience. 

3. **Be kind** - commit an act of kindness. Some examples are buying someone a small gift, volunteering, donating to a cause. 

4. **Do loving-kindness meditation** - these kinds of meditations (can be found on apps like WakingUp by Sam Harris) have been found to promote empathy, feelings of self-compassion. They have also been show to broaden perception. 

5. **Imagine your ideal future** - write what Seligman, Rashid, and Parks (2006) called a Life Summary technique, where you assume that you are happy and prosperous in your life and then write your life summary from that base assumption. 

6. **Set realistic goals that provide meaning to you** - studies have shown that a person who has clarity around personal goals and expectations is more likely to feel happier and content (Steger, Kashdan, Oishi, 2008; Steger, Oishi, Kashdan, 2009).

7. **Journal** - write "What went well" at the end of each day day, about that day for a week or more. Also identify your strengths (via a strengths finders test, can be found online) and then write about when you used those strengths at the end of the day, if you did, indeed, us that strength.
