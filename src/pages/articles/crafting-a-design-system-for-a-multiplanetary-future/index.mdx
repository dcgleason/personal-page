Definition: Script Includes are reusable server-side script logic that define a function or class. Script Includes execute their script logic only when explicitly called by other scripts. There are different types of Script Includes: On demand/classless. Extend an existing class.

Ok. Let's break this down. An on demand or classless script include has one or multiple functions declared in it (see below).

<Image src={serviceNow} alt="" />

A script include that is defined using a Class has the ability to be instantiated and can also have multiple functions in it that can be called separately. This is a difference between a classless script include and a script include that is defined using Classes... with a classless script include, if you have multiple functions, they can not be differentiated -- they can only run in sequence. 

Here is an example of a script include that is defined as a class.

<Image src={serviceNowTwo} alt="" />

See how the syntax for creating a Class script include is different?  Inside the the initialize function, you can declare instance variables.

<Image src={serviceNowThree} alt="" />

You can also extend classes with script includes. The purpose of extending a script include would be to add methods or non-method properties to it. Here is the syntax for extending a script include.

<Image src={serviceNowFour} alt="" />

One can extend a script include using the GlideAjax class, which allows you to call server side from a client side script. More on that [here](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/learning-plans/tokyo/new_to_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_scripting_tokyo_extending_glideajax). 

Now, to call a script include that is defined by a Class, you need to instantiate the class into an object and then call the functions by name using dot notation.

<Image src={serviceNowFive} alt="" />

A classless / on demand script include is simply called by name, and arguments are passed into it. It could look like this:

<Image src={serviceNowSix} alt="" />
<Image src={serviceNowSeven} alt="" />

Good luck and have fun coding.
